EXT. SANCTUARY, GEBA - MORNING
LONG SHOT - BELL, SUN - EASE OUT - 00:57
A funeral bell tolls as the rosy dawn rises above distant clouds overcasting the hills of a rocky desert wilderness. A priest pulls on a rope that swings a pendulum into a large bell. Out of our periphery, it crashes into the sun which unleashes a reverberating clang that disperses in all directions, spilling out over the landscape. An eagle caws over the horizon of a homely rural village nestled into the mountainside's rocky glade.

SUPER IMPOSE: Northern Israel, Late Bronze Age

A mourning colored woman, beats her breast and tears at her robe.
She pulls clumps of soil from the earth and throws them in her hair.

Phineas leads prayer for wailing funeral procession presiding over a dead woman's body which rests embalmed and draped in sackcloth.
Several priests burn incense and read from scrolls.

Phineas: Those who turn away from the remembrance of their Father commit a grave act of sin. 0:05 For it is only the slavish soul 1 who befriends its lot here, 1 harvesting beneath the horizon, 1 wandering amid thorns. - 4 Thus, - 1 the exalted in us must willingly depart, -1 leaving behind it -1 a worldly plight, - 1 so that we may return to our father, - 1 and forever dwell in him across the threshold of this dark wilderness, - 5 where we will ascend to inherit - 1 an empire - 1 of light. - 1

EWS - TREE/SOUTH - STEADICAM - 01:01

A Tamarisk tree stands mightily above the horizon in a field of swaying wild grass. In the distance we see mountains and A Shepard leading his flock through the peaceful wilderness. We hear Phineas's distant ringing muffled by whirling sedimentary gusts. In the distance we hear a ewe's excited bleats. A pair of dogs bark and play with a pair of laughing children who run off into the flock with a dog. It parts itself and runs from them while the Shepard scolds them. From behind the kicked up dust Two men approach carrying large rucksacks and leading a pair of donkeys towards the tree. A flash of distant lightning flickers as thunder rumbles over the hilly terrain. Sandy gusts whiz by our view.

To his left, Attendant leans against the tree roots and stuffs a fruit in his mouth before drums out a quick measure on a miniature drum he holds in his lap.

Abdiheba: Nothing that couldn't be stopped with a firm hand and proper rearing.
Abdiheba chops the air in front of him. Phineas nods in agreement.

Abdiheba: So it is said.
EXTREME LONG SHOT - EAGLE, PHINEAS -ZOOM
We follow the men from a high angle.
Abdiheba: However in truth, I have heard several renditions of the most unfortunate circumstance under which The Ark was lost.
They stop to converse between highpeaks. Pedestrians pass by while the two men cautiously speak.
Abdiheba: Some say that when it was taken, 2 you and your brother were also lost in battle 1 and, 4|2 %nn upon hearing of the death of his two sons, 1 your father fell from his chair 3 and subsequently -2 died.
Phineas nods.
Phineas: Yes. May he rest with his fathers.
Abdiheba: Yet you survived? How?
Phineas: The night before the battle, 1 we received word from our informants that 1 Philistine forces placed a large bounty on the heads of my brother and I. 3|2 %nn Upon this discovery, 2 %nn I ordered two of our men to take the field dressed in our robes so that we could control our battalions from behind the lines. 3%nn2 Unfortunately, 1 Hophni, 1 having the willful nature that he did, 1 allowed himself to fall for their bait 1 and so he refused. 1 %nn He believed that possession of The Ark alone 2 would be sufficient to protect us. 5|4 %nn When we found his body, 2 we redressed another of our dead in my priestly robes 3 and affixed the pair to a chariot which got sent back to THE PHILISTINE CAMP. 4|2 %NN IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE NEWS SPREAD THAT 2 THE HIGH PRIESTHOOD OF ISRAEL HAD BEEN SLAIN 1|1%NN WITH 1 ONE 2 swift 3 blow. 5%nn
Abdiheba: A brilliant stratagem. And your wife? Was that also a fabrication?

Phineas and Levi continue walking
Phineas: By spring the heathens will amass another invading force just over there, at foot of this hill.
Phineas points. Into the distance.
Abdiheba: Here? But why not siege one of the more populous cities further west where your reinforcements lie, such as Gibeon?
Phineas: Because they cannot win there. 3 Their goal is not to simply neutralize a hazardous threat, 2 but to terrorize 1 and ultimately eradicate 1 the Israeli 1 population. 2|1 %nn They will begin by building encampments 1 all along our borders where we have the least regional influence. 2|1 %nn Such as here. 4|2 %nn From these checkpoints. 1 They will launch a systematic campaign of slaughter against our population, 2 save the women 4|1 %nn who will be spared to promulgate their wicked seed. 2|3 Thus, finally annihilating our people...
Abdiheba: How have you come to know of this? 2| %nn
Phineas: Our eyes are many... 1|3%iEven% within your own kingdom, 1 magistrate. 3|0
Abdiheba: A peculiar admission to make to an emissary from an adversarial state, wouldn't you say? 3|2 %nn Pharaoh Amenhotep would not be pleased to hear of this. 3|2
Phineas nods.

Abdiheba: Then why do you share this with %i me? //Lilting

A crowd gathers ahead of the two men by a tavern dug into the recess of the mountain. We follow Phineas who excuses himself through the crowd asAbdi-Abdiheba Struggles To Keep Up. They stop Besides Steps Leading Down Where the Bar Serves Its Guests. Phineas invites Abdiheba to join him
AWAIT - TOUCH - PHINEAS
Abdiheba scales the steps and Phineas blocks his servant from following. The guards move in and stand by the steps blocking his advance. The two men walk under the sunlight seeping through the space's patchwork cloth awning and casts gentle shadows over the bustling crowd. The men order at the bar andfind a seat by the front porch.
MEDIUM SHOT - TABLE/FRONT - 00:18
The men take seats on small crates by a table with a small cloth over a crate. Dinah, a beautiful caramel colored young woman, comes over and pours them tea. Abdiheba looks her up and down. She meekly smiles and walks off to help other guests.

Phineas coughs violently into acloth and shows it to Abdiheba.
AWAIT - TOUCH - CLOTH

Tracking
Like Dinah's skirt fluttering in thewind, a tattered garment fastenedaround one of the porch's supportingbeams flails above its dusty maroonawning. The patchwork collage ofstitched together fabrics acts as ashield against the harsh desert sun forthe tavern's patrons. It wavers in thebreeze below Levi who collectsdonations while Dinah blushes andspeaks demurely in a nearby group ofwomen. We pedstall down to see Phineasand Abdiheba sitting at small tablewhere beams of sunlight pour over thepair as they pick at olives from asmall dish.
Abdiheba: So why have you summoned me here?
Phineas: We know about egypt's trade routes through Jerusalem. how they have been compromised by hapiru raiders.
We move closer.
Phineas: Yet your appeals for reinforcements from pharaoh have, so far, been met with silence.
Two philistines approach and Dinahwelcomes them to sit. They smile at hermenacingly and joke to each other.Dinah tries to ignore them. Phineascoughs and clears his throat as Dinaharrives.

MWS - PHINEAS/FRONT, TABLE - EASE IN - 00:37
Phineas waves the waiter off and he withdraws with a bow.
Abdiheba: And what do you know about Egypt's internal affairs?
Phineas smiles broadly.
Phineas: Come, please do not mistake my concern for meddling. Our people would gain little by frivolously injecting ourselves into regional matters which do not concern us. %nn Still, we must also remain pragmatic and treat those that do with a certain level of sensitivity. %nn You know that we retain close ties with those tribes.
Abdiheba: So what is it that you want?
Phineas: A virgin offering.
Abdiheba: %i What?
Phineas finishes stirring his tea and taps it on the side of his cup. He gestures to be silent and looks around.

MEDIUM SHOT - PHINEAS, ABDIHEBA - 00:17
We see Abdiheba consider this and look up wildly at us.
Phineas.OS: In exchange, you need not worry about it ever being sacked.
Abdiheba: A lofty proposal from the mouth of slave drivers! %nn When you release the men captured during your conquest of our homeland, perhaps then we can begin to speak of reparations.
MEDIUM SHOT - ABDIHEBA, PHINEAS - EASE IN - 00:14
Phineas dismisses the criticism.
Phineas: Here it would serve us best to leave history for others to debate. Allow yourself to consider this. %nn Present the details of our alliance to the Philistine leadership, making it appear as though it were an attempt to secede from Egyptian rule.
MEDIUM SHOT - PHINEAS, ABDIHEBA - 00:15
Phineas.OS: However, when you do so, you must indicate that our loss of The Ark forebodes an imminent collapse. A sign of our weakness, and eroding moral standards. %nn This small gesture alone will be enough to convince them of your apparent allegiance.
MEDIUM SHOT - ABDIHEBA, PHINEAS - EASE IN - 00:24
Phineas taps his tea with his index finger.
Phineas: Of course, because the notion itself is so absurd, no one will ever suspect our involvement with you. %nn Nor would they ever consider a local chieftain capable of defying the great pharaoh.
Phineas smiles wrly and coughs.
AWAIT - TOUCH - TEA
Phineas shakily sips his tea to clear his throat. He huffs out the rest while catching his breath.
Phineas: Promise them the gift that we were to receive.
MEDIUM SHOT - PHINEAS, ABDIHEBA - 00:10
Abdiheba laughs.
Abdiheba: I am uncertain whether that many virgins can be found within all of Israel. %nn We perhaps have, at most, two-hundred.

Phineas: Say we provide the rest?

MEDIUM SHOT - PHINEAS, ABDIHEBA - 00:25
Abdiheba looks glances at the approaching guard, then at Phineas as he nods considering what he is saying.
Abdiheba: Go on.
Phineas: The girls will spend a night in this place to become carriers of the illness ailing us here. %nn The following day they will be brought forth as wives to the Philistines. %nn Before long, their legions will be infected by debilitating boils and madness by the time they will have the chance to regroup against us.
Abdiheba: I see.
MEDIUM SHOT - ABDIHEBA, PHINEAS - 00:18
PHINEAS: YOU, IN TURN, WILL SEIZE A GLORIOUS VICTORY FOR YOUR MASTERS BY STABILIZING THEIR TRADE THROUGHOUT THE REGION - THE LAND WE TOOK from you. %nn Perhaps one day our temporary alliance could flourish into a truce between our people, a triumph that could be proclaimed for the ages.
Phineas clears his throat. His eyes wander in the distance.

Abdiheba.OS: If what you say is true, then why do Your townsmen not abandon their hardship here?
Phineas.OS: And which land would receive them?
MEDIUM SHOT - PHINEAS, ABDIHEBA - 00:08
Abdiheba: But why not try? Otherwise the women and children here will most surely suffer. %nn How does it benefit them to carry the burden of a nation?

Abdiheba.OS: And what comfort is there for those who never knew their father?
Phineas's eyes grow angry and he looks off

Town residences line half of its perimeter with the rest bordering an expanse of farmland at the foot of a woody expanse. Behind it, storm clouds shroud the glowing sunset. Against subdued rusty hues, shadowy figures retreat from fieldwork. their trundling shapes carry sickles and pick axes. A few still dig in the distance. A pack of dogs slink in the darkness. Under the nearby shelter of low hanging branches dark figures lurk around a bonfire and play drums. They point at the visitors with interest.
An Old Man wearing a hood appears, hauling a large shovel over his shoulder, and pauses in the field. He removes his hood and wipes his dirty face as he approaches the travelers. His brow wrinkles under layers of grit and sweat. Dinah urges Levi to speak with him.

Kish: Enjoying supper? Where are you all coming from?
Levi: Bethlehem. Just passing through on the way to Ephraim. We will be gone first thing in the morning.

Taking notice of Dinah's lyre leaning against the wall, he points to it with the knife. Ner picks it up.
Kish: Now which of you is the bard?
The Attendant shakes his head in humiliation. Dinah's eyes widen and look to Levi, who sits petrified and avoids all visual contact.
Dinah: It is mine.
Levi: And the flute is mine. The drums are his.
Levi gestures to the Attendant who nods. 3
Kish: A troupe no less! Would you mind?
Kish requests Dinah's hand and she rises looking shocked at Levi who grips the table trembling. Ner hands the instrument to Dinah, who begrudgingly snatches it from his grip. The boy walks behind Levi and hangs his flute over his shoulder. his leg nervously twitches as he presses his eyes shut and clutches his hands, silently praying.
Kish: Oh but not here. Perhaps we would could all enjoy a private show outdoors under the moonlight 3 now that the rain let up?

CUT TO:
EXT. WOODS, GEBA - NIGHT
The cabin's entrance quickly vanishes behind the rushing shades. The effulgence of the moon illuminates their pale outlines hopping over a stream. Their cries rise above the canyon as they plunge into the wilderness. Whipping shrubs brush past the roving band, where patches of moon light drops through the thistly bosk to illuminate their demonic grimaces in bobbing bright strobes. they look back anxiously.
Dinah's chest palpitates rapidly, swept up in a flurry of sharp movements. Struggling to reach the ground, she swings her lyre wildly and IT MAKES CONTACT WITH THE SIDE OF THE GIANT'S SKULL - AND AGAIN - SIMULTANEOUSLY FLAYING OPEN HIS SCALP AND INSTIGATING THE GRIP FIRMLY held around her flailing torso. Against his enraged grunts, the reverberating thrash of the instrument's snapping chords tears through the air like warped thunder. Chemosh violently tears it away, and smotheringly castigates her fruitless wails for help. Wild flocks fly toward the moon hoping to evade the melee. Instinctively she bites down, an action met with a recoiling howl, and they pause to let Ashtar rebuke. With a swift strike, he sweeps darkness over her eyes, rolling, as she submerges into unconsciousness.
A dull, repetitive spank ricochets off the kneeling girl's cheeks as the suitors take turns slapping them. Her vision wanders, focusing from a panoply of indistinct shapes into the nightmarish form of their sallow shades. They pull her up and twirl her from one place to the other. Her gown unravels as the world spins and she hits a rock, sliding to the ground with a thud.
Dinah turns around, barely covered, pulling herself onto scraped knees and cries. She takes off her necklace, clasps the pendant in her hands and prays silently. The bandits whisper amongst themselves.
Dinah: Father,
May thy name be holy.
May thy kingdom come.
May thy will be done.
Give us today our needed bread.
And forgive us our sins.
As we forgive those who sin against us.
And lead us not into temptation.
But deliver us from evil.
Amen.
All except Kish and Ner encircle the pathetic figure to ridicule and taunt her matted mane, sodden with grime, which they saw away by the fistful with blades. Gleefully, they skip parading the clumped chunks howling like madmen as she pleads for her life in repentance. They exchange sneers and mock her prayers, Ashtar on his knees, and Chemosh clutching his fists at the sky. The giant pretends to cry like a baby.
Ashtar: Mocking girl voice, abba! Abba! Help me father! Save me!
Chemosh: Demonic, where is your messiah? He will burn in hell!
Meanwhile Kish gently shoos them.
Kish: No need for that. We each have our gods.
The other men chant softly. She continues praying under her breath.
Kish: Dear maiden. What have you got there? Go on. Show us.
A thread dangles from her palms, she slowly unfolds them to reveal her mother's decorated pendant, and they sparkle in faint light. Kish chuckles and steps forward to toss the harp on the ground.
Kish: Here. play a song for our little brother then.
Kish steps aside and extends his arms in welcome to present Ner into an illuminated spotlight. A howling gust passes and his cape catches it, flowing gently.
Walking forward, Ner breaths heavily, and peers up to his brother through the holes of his cracked mask. He turns again to the trembling Dinah, who picks up the weathered lyre. Several of its chords now dangle unhinged. Holding it tightly to her b/EAST, her eyes move from one menacing grin to the next. Slowly, she wields the apparatus. She stares at the child. He has a vacuous expression as Kish pats him on the shoulder.
Kish: Well, go on, the whore's all yours. I know it would not be your first.
Kish winks at Ner who is frightened by the implication. He timidly glances at his hovering older brother.
Kish: Or if it is past your bedtime, we will take over?
Dinah rocks in place morosely, a ruddy strand of saliva streams from her quivering lips. Her shaking hand strums the pick over untuned strings to release an unsettling discordant chord. The pluck of each note emits an increasingly dissonant pitch. Unimpressed, Kish inquires.
Kish: You can sing too cannot you?
Her attempts to produce more than puttering spurts of fluid are futile as she holds back from sobbing. The men mock her lack of words.
Ashtar: The bitch is done.
Chemosh: The whores I know go all night.
Kish kneels, meeting Dinah at eye level and snatches the pick away from her.
Dinah: No!
HE TILTS HIS HEAD COYLY TOWARDS HER - REPULSED, SHE RECOILS AND SPITS IN HIS FACE. WIPING HIS FACE, HE SPIKES THE PICK ONTO THE FLOOR AND glares. He pounces, viciously winding his hand around her locks and cocks her head back. Forcing the other between her thighs, she croaks and claws away his groping hand. Ashtar and Chemosh hook her arms, restraining her ability to combat his descent.
Chemosh.OOV: Keep still ya' sow!
A rapid torrent of convulsions undermine Dinah's capacity to breathe as her wheezing gasps for air gurgle and bubble. She screams wildly and, scared, Ner trips backing away to the stream. Kish's sweating brow slowly rises over her stomach to reveal his snarling blood-streaked cheeks. Above the men's cackle, he bares his teeth and growls savagely at Dinah, who screams in terror.
Kish: Keep moving cunt and I will slit your fucking throat. Your little faggot back there will be next.
Again she screams as the boy stands by the stream shocked and takes off his mask.
Dinah.OS: Hysterical, noooo!
Cow-eyed, Dinah's bruised limbs slacken. The bandits shove one another for a chance to mount her. Their derisive snickers echo. The soft rays of light hang over their dragging fingers, which tear at her supple flesh. Her limbs helplessly flail as the savages lecherously gnaw at her limbs. Limp, she lays in a state of shock gazing at the moon.
We see the moon. They howl at it. One after the other, their outlines merge. Ner looks on. She gropes the floor for the necklace and clutches onto it beneath the forceful thrusts. Tears stream down Ner's cheek and terror strikes hers as the two fleetingly connect between her violent waves of anguish. Embarrassed, he turns away from the others, who masturbate around Kish and Dinah, and drops his mask into the brook. It glides fluidly along the moon's warping reflection.
Fade out:
CUT TO:
EXT. MARSH, GEBA - MORNING
Rosy bands of sunshine stretch between the marsh's swaying auburn cover onto red-winged blackbirds who lounge delicately on swampy marsh reeds. One chirps melodically and flies off to avoid the bloody hand leaving stains where they perched. Dinah runs water over her battered body, softly sobbing from its sting. Wading through the muddy stream she holds her head in shame, staring back at her beaten reflection. Ner lurks nearby and follows in pursuit along the road.
CUT TO:
EXT. ANAT'S HOME, GEBA - MORNING
Dinah's bare ravaged figure ambles along the dusty path towards the cabin like an apparition. She trips onto the ground before its steps and Ner jumps forward but, shocked by her battered appearance, stops short of helping. Stunned, the boy backs away from the paunch of her cheeks which quiver in tawny lumps beneath the purple slits of her eyelids.
Anat swiftly moves in to hold a pitcher to Dinah's mouth, gently supporting her neck as water falls from the victim's swollen lips. She, astonished to see Ner, drops the pitcher and slowly rises with contempt on her face, glancing back towards the house. Forbidding her ascent, Dinah puts a hand on the girl's forearm and shakes her head in disapproval. They hear movement in the house. Anat nods at Ner, and again towards the brush. Terrified, he jumps for cover beside the stream. Between overgrown weeds, Anat helps Dinah onto the threshold of the patio and stumbles. The door cracks open.
Levi emerges with bloodshot eyes cast down above his mangled face. Across it, an open gash runs across his cheek, terminating at his parted bottom lip. The boy trembles watching Dinah curling fetally at her mate's feet. Anat shuffles aside as he steps over her and continues down the path past Ner, who crouches but keeps his eyes fixed on the collapsed woman. The stems of overgrown wildflowers sway in her breath as she wheezes. Levi returns to her leading the donkeys but the Attendant rushes outside to forestall his approach. In a final moment of strength, Dinah closes the pendant in Anat's hand and collapses. Its ivory eye shimmers brightly in the sun. While the two men tussle, her breathing calms to a halt and they stop in acknowledgement of defeat. The Attendant rests against Levi, hugging and crying. Her eyes glaze over. Ner's frightened eyes are the last thing Dinah sees. A shadow stands in the distance next to Ner in the grass. We see the group from the shade's perspective.
CUT TO:
EXT. ANAT'S HOME, GEBA - MORNING
Levi slumps next to Dinah's body and rocks, cradling her in his arms. Beads of sweat run down his impassive face. Anat sits against the house watching them behind hugged knees. The Attendant sits along the road weaving a crown of flowers and alternates between reminiscent smiles and sobbing. Ner, sweating and confounded, studies them in hiding and swallows. Levi loops his arms under Dinah's and begins to get up. The Attendant stands but Levi shakes his head. Turning around to pull her body, her hair catches in the bramble beside them. He swipes at it, breaking branches and nearly dropping her. Ner gasps and steps into the stream making a splash.
Levi shoots a wild glare toward the sound and surveys the boy's hiding place. Running over, Anat throws herself at Dinah's feet sobbing loudly. The house entrance opens and the Old Man tearfully walks over to comfort her. She grabs at his legs and wails loudly. The Attendant places the crown on Dinah. With the others distracted, she glares at the boy. He wipes his eyes and nods.
Stoically, Levi's shadow loads Dinah's on one of the donkeys. The Old Man's joins the Attendant's on the road as the pair watches the two ride off. Nearby, Anat has a clear view of Ner's escape through the field. His shadow runs frantically behind the house into the woods. She frowns and squints at Dinah's pendant which hangs around her neck, then down at the boy's mask caught in a reed along the stream's current. We follow the current along the ground to the road where the shadows of the Attendant sobbing. Further down the road the clopping of the donkey's.OOVes trail dust in front of their shadows as they carry Dinah's body, led by Levi.
CUT TO:
EXT. DESERT, UNKNOWN - CONTINUOUS
Their shadows trundle on and on and it gets dustier. We zoom out to find that Levi's shadow has disspeared, Leving only Dinah and the donkey. Her shadow pulls itself up and sits on the donkey. We continue to zoom out until we see her from a high angle looking around. She squints and covers her face, without casting a shadow on her body. We see the bright sun. We see her covering her face again and she looks around. We see her alone from high above in the middle of a vast desert. And higher again. Now from over her shoulder, she turns to see the twisting desolate landscape. She continues turning to see that several stars shine in the distance and pulse. She looks down at her hands and can see through them. She holds up her hand to the landscape and notices its translucency then notices a large structure in the background. It is the temple from Levi's dream. She walks towards it. Other shades appear on the horizon, their features look familiar but indistinct. They fade as she approaches them. The temple's door cracks open emitting a bright light.
CUT TO:
EXT. TAMARISK TREE, GEBA - AFTERNOON
The ebb and flow of insects sing in the swaying grass under sunset. Ner sits against it in a sullen state of remorse. He plays with a pebble and hears chicks overhead. Dinah frowns, standing in the distance. She is about to walk over when Anat appears along the road leading up to him. Dried tears sit on her reddened cheeks. They say nothing.
He looks up to see the eagle's eggs have hatched. The little creatures cry out for their mother but none comes. He looks down at the stone, covers his ears and hangs his head in shame, softly weeping. Dinah thinks to herself and frowns. The girl walks over and sits, lovingly comforting him. She rests her head on his shoulder.
DISSOLVE:
EXT. TAMARISK TREE, GEBA - EVENING
Anat awakes to the chicks's soft song, whose chirps are now more intermittent. She and Ner hold hands in the early dusk light. Dinah sits cross legged in the distance watching the sunset when, startled, she sees Kish watching them. Anat covers up her shoulder, waking Ner in panic.
Anat: Go home.
Dinah stands panicked. Ner rubs his eyes and walks along the road by his older brother who slaps his head as he passes. Anat gasps and shakes as Kish stares at her sternly. Without a word, he turns away down the path. Dinah follows in pursuit. We see her face grow grave an concerned, then suddenly flames reflect on it as she looks away.
INT. BANDIT'S HIDEOUT, GEBA - EVENING
A fire burns at the center of the destitute shed, giving its ensconced space a foul sooty air. Its indigent interior, held together by rickety scaffolding, is lit by an opening in the roof where billowing tufts of gray disperse. Above the stove, a boiling stew cooks in a witch's cauldron. Besides the flame, a makeshift table lies crowded by an array of pots and pans. Amid the disorder, the adolescent Ner sits at a small clearing, staring absently into his bowl of gruel.
The bandits lazed about the room indifferently. Ashtar sleeps on the floor while Moloch squats against a beam, looking up at the stars through the skylight. All but Kish take little notice of Ner's inaction. Reclining on a nearby cot, he scolds the child.
Kish: Eat up.
Ner's unresponsive sulking incites his older brother to hop out of bed to unleash a stiff shove of encouragement. The child attempts a sip but can't. Kish tries again, pushing the bowl to his lips, but then it goes flying as he spits up. The bandit holds the boy from fainting and rests his head against the table. He pets him as the two fall asleep together.

The tabernacle's outline looks like a shadow against the MORNING sky. Inside, Phineas writes scripture by a lantern. He hears a commotion outside and gets up to investigate.

A crowd gathers around the barn as Levi emerges from its stables sweating, blood soaked and dazed. Men jump back from his ghastly appearance and peak inside. Women gasp and hide their children as the Levite slaps an ass to haul off a tied sack. He walks past the onlookers wearily and closes the front door.

He is flanked flanked by carved marble lions under flaming torches and towering sandstone statues of ancient pagan gods. Ornate oriental rugs generously line the sooty columned space and under them musicians drum out layered beats accented by interleaving stringed and wooded melodies. The chief fondles his beard and pulls a drag from a hookah while his entourage paws at his sides.
Their master bellows a hearty laugh and raises his clay goblet in approval of his harem. Their belly dance echoes off the granite walls. Deftly they weave around one another with synchronistic ease. The fringe of their elaborate sequined frocks jingle, trailing below a bevy of thick thighs that pump seductively with voluptuous undulation. Ogling over their shapely form, Abdiheba bites his lip and sways rhythmically matching the cadence of the rolling oiled torsos.
The master shoots an irritated scowl towards the slight young man appears clutching a cloth sack with note affixed. he signals his approach. Swiftly, the messenger moves through the crowd. Displeased by the interruption, the aristocrat snatches the note and hastily undoes its seal.
Abdiheba's face sours and raises his hand. The room grinds to a halt and its inhabitants exchange uneasy glances, drawing closer to hear the news. Mouthing the letter he reads,
Abdiheba: Lords of Israel -

A panicked bandit lets himself into the room. Ashtar and Moloch vault to attention. Kish awakes holding Ner.
Ashtar: Crowds are gathering to protest about that girl! They say she is been found and are looking for the assailants! A herald carrying a PACKAGE IS ON HIS WAY HERE TO DELIVER NEWS ABOUT THE INCIDENT. WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
Kish: We will intercept it before it gets here. Come with me. You two look after Ner.
Kish props his brother onto the counter and leaves.

Obed wades through a surging throngs in the square of Bethlehem. The cacophonous roar of indistinct chatter layers itself over a dirge of cries and whispers. He struggles to peak over them.

E/I. LEVI'S PORCH, EPHRAIM - MOMENTS LATER
A mob brandishes sticks and throws rocks at the barn. The Attendant wades through to the front door and bangs urgently. He ducks under thrown stones and looks up in despair. Levi looks down at him from the window. In the distance, kemul, a clear eyed sage with white whiskers and a full silvery mane, approaches on horseback accompanied by a cavalry. They point towards the commotion as the Attendant looks back at them, then at Levi, and runs off. Levi closes the window's shutter. He slumps over the bed and hides his face with bloody hands sobbing.
Abdiheba.VO: With each twelve taken, my heart lies more rent and undone.

Abdiheba.VO: Dinah, daughter of Bethlehem. whom the sons of Benjamin thought right to desecrate.
Closer, Obed makes out the message nailed to the post. His pallid face drips in the torrid desert noon, striking dread into those around him. A path forms. The air is still. He drifts forward, trembling with mouth agape. The people's attention shifts inward, following his unsteady gait. Shrouded women hide their faces. Grown men fight back tears. Their children naively gawk.

Abdiheba.VO: Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to Benjamin!
Ner sleeps unmoved. He awakes to Kish bursting in through the door breathing laboriously. He pushes Ner out of the way and clears the table's surface. Pots and pans fall to the floor generating a startling series of rings and clangs. They huddle around him.
Kish throws a sack onto the table. Encircling it, they exchange morose glares. Ner vomits.
CUT TO:
EXT. TOWN SQUARE, BETHLEHEM - MOMENTS LATER
Obed contorts into a precipitous state of horror. Following the shaft to its base reveals Dinah's severed hand lying by itself on a small fold of cloth. Jumping to take hold of the remains, he presses it tightly against his cheeks and collapses into a moribund rut. The Old Man's wiry features clump together in a sickly jaundiced down. A rising tide of lamentation courses through the town. Obed's eyes roll, and he convulses violently. Three men claw away the hand and attempt to restrain him. Upon breaking free, he throws himself to the ground, tearing at his clothes and hair. He kneels in supplication and chokes. Grasping at his chest he collapses foaming at the mouth. In a final moment of desperation he reaches towards the heavens.

INT. LEVI'S ROOM, EPHRAIM - MOMENTS LATER
Levi sits sobbing in a pile of red soaked hay. He looks down at his trembling clotted hands. His soaked face grimaces in grief-stricken anguish as he looks up, shocked, by the forced entry into his room.

All eyes lock on the package uneasily. Abdiheba breathes heavily as he finishes reading.
Abdiheba: Levi of Ephraim.
Abdiheba commands the herald to place the sack in the center of the hall. He opens the bag.
Abdiheba: Everyone out except for you.
The crowd leaves. Some moments pass. The messenger remains.
Abdiheba: Is there anything else?
Messenger: The Prophet Phineas requests your audience.
Abdiheba: Yes... Tell him that we will arrange an entourage and leave for Ephraim tomorrow.
Messenger: The Prophet is on his way.
Abdiheba: %i What?
Messenger: The Prophet is already on his way here. He will arrive by nightfall.
Phineas nods searchingly and scowls. The messenger bows and leaves.
Abdiheba: Thank you.

And he bows
Abdiheba: Father.
Phineas: All tribes, save Benjamin, have reported receiving a similar message. 2 Rather coincidental timing 3 wouldn't you say?
Abdiheba: How so?
Phineas: It was rumored that you nephew was the cause of this %i atrocity that was just commited in Gibeah. 3 Do you mean to deny this?
AWAIT - TRACE #DOWN ABDIHEBA
Abdiheba shakes his head and lowers himself into his seat, quietly sobbing into his hands.
Abdiheba: We've encouraged the boy to straighten out but nothing seems to curb his appetites. That foul nature of his. His father is well known, Abiel, the mayor of Gibeon.
Phineas: I know. We today spoke in likewise capacity.
Abdiheba: He sent his two sons to be raised here once a similar predicament arose at home...
Phineas: He has a brother?
Abdiheba nods.
Abdiheba: Much younger. 3 Though this is hardly a place for children, 3 and so they were sent to Geba, where I have some farmland and a staff that was to tend to them. 3 Evidently they only knew how to raise animals.
Abdiheba sobs.
Phinehas: Well, this most recent outburst of his has made our position, 2 difficult. 3 Why, with tensions running high since the loss of The Ark, compounded by the reports of mass abduction here in Jerusalem, suspicions among the elder members of the twelve tribes have only been aggravated. 2Unsubstantiated as they may at first appear. 5| %nn Some have begun to speculate... that 2 there lies a credible connection between us. 3 Implicating that I somehow have assisted your attempt to secede from Egypt to the Philistines 3 and that destabilizing Israel's internal situation was the lever we pulled to compromise its ability to adequately defend itself against a foreign threat. 3 For those with a more fertile imagination, it begs the question whether the entire matter was 3 intentional.
Abdiheba: A provocation?
Abdiheba nods.
Abdiheba: And the author of the message? Where is he?
Phineas: Apprehended back at his home in Ephraim. He mentioned how you led them there to begin with.
Abdiheba bows his head in shame.
Abdiheba: Were there any accomplices?
Phineas nods.
Phineas: We can't be sure where the others are at the moment. But it's only a matter of time before they are caught.
Abdiheba: Mmm. Were there any other witnesses? What about the victim's family?
Phineas: Her father, but I am afraid that upon receiving the news, he suddenly passed away.
ABDIHEBA: MMM. AND THIS WAS - THAT STUDENT OF YOURS WHO DID THIS?
Phineas: Yes. Levi. But I gather that you already know this.
Abdiheba raises his eyes with an agitated look of concern. Abdiheba looks away and grinds his teeth while tapping on the head of one of the lions next to his throne.
Abdiheba: Is there any way that we can remedy this ourselves? I can send men to find them.
Phineas: We are beyond that now. A tribunal will be arranged at Mizpah to put them all to trial. 3 The Tribe of Benjamin's fate will also be at stake as they also bear responsibility for lack of a proportional response. 3 Your attendance will be expected as well to vindicate your involvement with these most unfortunate series of unrelated events.
Abdiheba: And should any party not be present to receive judgement?
Phineas: Then may God help us all.
Abdiheba lowers his eyes. Phineas withdraws into the dark columns bowing.

Levi looks around menacingly. The crowd is loud now.

Phineas.OS: Today I, as %i The %i Kohanim %i of %i Isreal, have requested attendance with this holy council, 2 decedents of the sons of Jacob, chiefs 3 to the twelve tribes of Israel, 2 to seek judgment for the unfathomable atrocity committed in Geba 3 where a daughter of Judah 2 was savagely tortured 2 and abandoned 1 by the sons of Benjamin. 5 Though the decision to do so was not made lightly, as it is well known there are open questions regarding the merit in debating the lives of the accursed, a lowly sheep herder, or the victim, an alleged harlot. However, 2 in contrast to accounts about how either made her living, 1 their souls, like that of all sinners here, 3 will remain eternally cherished in the eyes of His blessed grace, The Lord our God. 3 Therefore, 2 the pain they have felt should be felt %i equally by each of us here 3 and as part of our covenant 3 we %i must 1 seek atonement in the form of a just verdict. 3 It is the intention of this tribunal to hear the words of those who will guide the hand of fate 2 to determine which among us 2 bears the most blame 1 in these heinous 1 and unprovoked acts 1 of barbarism.

Phineas: Yes shoftim, the captive is ready.
Judges.OS: Then step forward. And is a representative from the tribe of Benjamin present to defend against the charges?
Phineas looks to either side and points to the scribe. The crowd search and whisper among themselves.
Judges.OS: Let it be noted that Benjamin is absent, forfeiting our ability to pursue a verdict against either them or the captive. I am afraid that will be all.
The brothers look at each other in confusion as the crowd murmurs surprised.
Phineas: Judges.
They peer at Phineas and nod, inviting him to step forward to speak.
AWAIT - TOUCH - PHINEAS
Phineas steps forward to speak.
Phineas: Given the exceptional nature of the situation, I propose that I, an impartial vassal of the state, provide council in their stead as they are unable to themselves.
The judges looks around in surprise.
Judges.OS: Kohanim Phineas , this is a highly unusual gesture and, in my opinion, reflects on the state of this nation's unity almost as poorly as abandoning this trial altogether. However, it is with reluctance that, for the sake of our people, I am inclined to support your motion.
Judges.OS: I second the motion. If any are opposed, speak now... Very well, so held.
The crowd murmurs curiously as Kish looks relieved and pats Ner on the back excitedly.
JUDGES.OS: LET US CONTINUE THEN. CAPTIVE - STEP FORWARD TO STATE YOUR NAME AND PLACE OF BIRTH SO THAT ALL IN ATTENDANCE MAY HEAR.
Ashtar and Chemosh emerge from the crowd's perimeter and nod at the brothers. Kish points at them and hands the boy a rock.
//TODO: introduce old man giving up daughter to Phineas as payment for not acting sooner against Kish
Kish: Wait until everyone is distracted, then pelt the fucker. Those two will help us if there is trouble.
The child acknowledges the command breathing heavily while his face transitions to bewilderment as the two watch on.
Levi.OOV: Levi, Levite of Ephraim
Abdiheba.OOV: Rushed legalise, Levi, Levite of Ephraim, is it your intention to testify before God and the twelve families of his holy nation that you are innocent of the atrocity committed in Geba against a daughter of Israel to whom you were not wed?
Levi.OOV: It is.
Abdiheba.OOV: Rushed legalise, Benjamin, tribe of Israel, is it your intention to testify before God and the twelve families of his holy nation that you are innocent of the atrocity committed in Geba against a daughter of Israel to whom none of your men were wed?
Phineas.OOV: It is.
Abdiheba.OOV: Who will provide testimony?
Phineas invites Levi to testify.
Abdiheba: Then tell us, how did this evil thing happen?
Levi: My... Dinah, my Attendant and I came to the land of Benjamin to spend the night on the way to Ephraim, where we ran into abiel, mayor of gibeon. Upon his advice, we sought shelter with friends of his in Geba, but the citizens there set out to harm me. They gathered against us...
Abdiheba raises his hand to stop.
Abdiheba: Captive. Do you mean to imply that the mayor of gibeon, by chance, extended his generosity to your party.
Levi: Yes judge.
Abdiheba: And was this given as a special courtesy to strangers or do you claim to know him personally?
The crowd laughs. Phineas leans to pull on Levi's arm but he shrugs it off violently.
Levi: We met at the tavern across the road from the barn where I left her. It was on a night that he was coming back from your stronghold in jerusalem.
The crowd murmurs. Abdiheba pauses to observe their response.
Abdiheba: Levite, you must be mistaken, since i, nor any member of the tribe of Judah, maintain any presence whatsoever in the sovereign LANDS BELONGING TO BENJAMIN - WHICH INCLUDES JERUSALEM... ABIEL, MAYOR OF GIBEON! STEP FORWARD TO TESTIFY.
The crowd whispers. Abiel steps through the crowd and scales the steps quickly, uncomfortably adjusting and preparing to speak. Kish and Ner duck and glance at one another, shocked.
Kish: Shit!
Abdiheba: Do you know this man?
ABIEL: YES - I DO.
The crowd is surprised.
Abdiheba: Please state the nature of your relationship to him.
Abiel: My party and I were heading back from shiloh when we decided to stay in Ephraim for the sabbath.
KEMUL: MAYOR, I WAS NOT AWARE THAT YOU WERE VISITING WITHIN MY JURISDICTION IN EPHRAIM - OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR US TO meet.
ABIEL: SHOFTIM, FORGIVE ME BUT I DID NOT THINK IT WAS WISE TO INCONVENIENCE YOU OVER SUCH A SHORT STAY - YOU SEE I WAS OVERSEEING preparations for shiloh's annual spring festival where I serve on the committee on cultural affairs.
Kemul: I see. That is very honorable of you. Which sabbath was it?
Abiel: I beg your pardon?
Kemul: The sabbath. On which did you stay?
Abdiheba: Shoftim kemul?
Kemul smiles and raises his hand.
Kemul: Indulge me.
ABIEL: RELUCTANT, ON - THE DAY OF ATONEMENT SIR.
The crowd whispers as Ner looks around guards who cross his line of fire.
Kemul: Aha. I just find it strange that you would be traveling on the holiest of days but I suppose that is up to your constituents in GIBEON TO DECIDE HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THAT MATTER. THOUGH, IF I MAY ASK, HOW DID YOU - COME UPON ATTAINING THIS APPOINTMENT IN SHILOH SO FAR from your home abiel?
ABIEL: IT WAS... JUDGE ABDIHEBA OF JUDAH WHO GAVE ME THE, HONORARY, APPOINTMENT THERE - SIR.
Kemul looks out the window to Abdiheba, who looks away in frustration.
Kemul: I see... Well please, continue.
Abiel: It was there, in Ephraim, where this young man came to my attention as a member of the synagogue. He was quite drunk at the time and publicly obsessing over the victim after she had denied his hand in marriage. But still intent on seeing her against her wishes, he pursued to her father's home in Bethlehem. That was the last I saw of him.
Kemul: Levi?
Levi: It is not true. We also later met on the road to jerusalem where he offered us shelter!
The crowd scoffs.
Abdiheba: Mayor abiel, given that I have no recollection of meeting with you recently, nor have I ventured outside Judah's capital at hebron until this trial,
Abdiheba looks to kemul, who squints suspiciously.
ABDIHEBA: I WILL GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT BY ASSUMING THIS YOUNG MAN, IN AN EXCITED STATE OF - INTOXICATION, HAD CONFUSED YOU FOR someone else, rather than consider you spreading baseless rumors about the nation's internal affairs. Thank you for your time mayor. Scribe, if shoftim kemul does not object, strike all mention of the mayor from the record.
Satisfied with the testimony, kemul nods. Abdiheba points at Levi.
ABDIHEBA: LEVITE, I WARN THAT YOU STRETCH THIS COURT'S PATIENCE BY MAKING DUBIOUS CLAIMS. PROCEED - BUT CAREFULLY.
The crowd whispers. Abiel steps down when his wandering gaze finds the brothers across the clearing. He recognizes them and glowers, continuing into the crowd. Phineas coaches Levi to proceed.
LEVI: THEY GATHERED AGAINST US AROUND THE HOUSE AT DUSK. THEY MEANT TO HAVE ME - BUT INSTEAD THEY RAVISHED THE GIRL UNTIL SHE DIED. AFTER they had their way with her, she died the next morning.
He takes off his hood showing his grotesque wound. Abdiheba squints and looks towards the other judges, whose eyes dart at one another in shock. The crowd talk excitedly. The brothers look to their sides for an opportunity. Phineas shakes his head remorsefully with a grieved look, and puts his hand on Levi's shoulder.
Levi: Then I took hold of her, and I cut her in pieces and sent them through every part of Israel's territory. So that everyone may know what Benjamin has done!
Levi turns violently to Phineas.
Kemul: Grave, young Levite, do you swear this to be true?
Levi: I do.
Ner gets ready to throw the stone but a man jumps out in front of them and shouts incredulously. He backs down.
Crowd: Liar! We do not believe you!
Kemul raises his hand hand authoritatively for silence.
Phineas: Honorable shoftim, as improbable as this all appears to be, I understand that the captive also purports to know the names of the assailants who are responsible.
Kemul: Is that correct?
Levi nods.
Kemul: Go on...
Levi: There were five. Two of them brothers, Kish and a little boy, Ner... I cannot recall the others.
Kemul: And they did this to you?
Kemul runs his finger down his cheek. Levi nods and weeps into his hands.
Levi: I will be damned for what I did to her after they were through. Damned!
Phineas wipes his eyes. The judges and crowd murmur loudly, obviously moved. Kemul clears his throat. Incensed, abiel stares directly at Kish and Ner. They drop the stones, anxiously ducking and turning for cover. Kish grimaces and braces against his brother tightly.
Kish: We are fucked! Get ready.
Kemul: My son, those are Benjaminic names though, unfortunately, since there are no witnesses, you leave us with no way to confirm your allegations.
Abdiheba looks around at the other judges. The Attendant pushes through the guards and runs out to his master hugging at his knees. Levi pulls away and shakes his head but his friend stays firm. The judges are shocked.
Phineas: Lord! It is the Levite's Attendant!
The Attendant nods and pleads on his knees. Levi falls to his knees weeping and the Attendant consoles him. Ner cocks to throw the stone but Kish hold him back.
Kish: Whispering, wait until he stands.
Kemul: Is he fit to testify?
Phineas: Are you able to act as an alibi, my son?
The Attendant nods. Phineas helps the two stand attentively and encourages them to speak. The crowd is entranced.
Kish: Now!
Ner throws the stone. It whizzes across the open space zipping towards Levi's head but falls short of its target. Instead, a loud clap echoes through the arena as it hits the Attendant. He looks to Levi in shock as the punctured wound in his forehead gurgles red. The brothers freeze as he collapses to the ground.
Kish drags the boy away, rushing through the crowd. Between the masses Levi points out their retreat, with a look of insanity. They frantically trip and lurch forward through the swarm, pitching beneath arches and careening around alleyways.
Crowd.OS: The Benjamites killed his alibi!
Ner bobs in his sibling's grip as they rush through the throngs. Kish struggles to keep his head cloaked. The boys commit to an all out sprint when a man scruffs Kish by his neck and drops Ner. The boy cowers as his brother is pummeled by the brute. One strike after the other, the albino's face gets beaten to a messy pulp. The Levite kneels by the Attendant and points at the brothers with his bound hands. The crowd clears around them.
Levi: There! An outrageous act of depravity has been committed in Israel! Now you are all Israelites. produce a plan of action here and now!
The crowd erupts in chaos as the judges stand. Abiel unsheathes his sword and threatens men back. Levi's explosive howl startles everyone to stop to look back at him wildly pleading with Phineas.
Levi: Is this my reward for spreading God's word? Was it my father's as well?
Phineas: Levi! Stop!
Abdiheba: Control him!
Levi pulls the Attendant's sword from it's sheath, brandishes it and breaks free of his bindings. Phineas cowers as he is pushed to the ground. Levi throws the sword next to him and waves his hands in the air savagely toward the judges. The guards surround the stairs and slowly climb them, holding spears.
Levi: Noooo! Now hear me! God, the father of heaven, I renounce you!
Shocked, Phineas looks at him with anguish.
Levi: The holy spirit of his people, I renounce you!
Enraged, Abdiheba glares at him grimacing.
Abdiheba: Sacrilege!
Levi: The messiah and his kingdom, I renounce you!
The two brothers are dumbstruck. Ner trembles. Abdiheba stands and points.
Abdiheba: Levi, Levite of Ephraim, you are guilty of committing heresy! Repent Now! Or receive a final judgement!
Levi: Hysterical, I will not! I renounce you! I renounce all of you!
Abdiheba: Phineas !
With tears in his eyes Phineas gets up and looks around at the guards closing in with spears. Picking up the sword he looks at it as if he needed to vomit. Slowly, he raises the blade in the air and shouts. They yell over each other as Phineas takes Levi by the shoulder, who shrugs him away and pushes him off.
Phineas: I adjure you, profligate heathen, by the power that judges the living and dead, by your creator, to repent!
Levi: I renounce you! I renounce you! I will not! I will not!
Levi yells at the sky.
Phineas: Then tremble before that mighty arm that broke asunder the dark and led us to light! With his power I consign you, sinner, to damnation! Depart then transgressor!
Levi: Abandon me as you have always abandoned us!
Abandon me as I now abandon you!
Depart from me!
Phineas swipes at Levi, who wavers momentarily in shock before his head is lopped off. It tumbles backwards and down the flight of stairs leaving the Levite's erect body grotesquely spurting from the neck, which then falls to its knees. The crowd cries out. Phineas throws the sword and crawls to hold his student, sobbing.
Phineas: Forgive him father! For it was the Benjamites who broke his spirit! Forgive your poor son for what he is done! Forgive him.
Suddenly a boulder drops down onto Kish's assailant, crushing him under his weight. Its thrower, Moloch, vaunts above them with a wild howl and his ankle is swept from under him. Two men beat him with clubs. The youthful bandits fly off beyond the skirmish and slow as they get farther. They glance over their shoulders as people run past them towards the chaos.
Crowd.OS: The Levite went mad with grief! %n It was not his doing! %n It was Benjamin that broke him! %n He spoke the truth! %n We will not go back to our homes! %n We will not enter our houses! %n We must wage war! We must purge the land of their sin! %n The Benjamites have cursed us! The swine! %n Woe unto our people!
The brothers find shelter behind a broken pillar from where they can recuperate with a clear view of the court. The judges debate amongst themselves. Abdiheba glares contemptuously at them and looks to Phineas who holds the Levite's limp body and shakes his head. Abdiheba stands, raising his hand to speak.
Abdiheba: Now this is what we will do to Geba! We will wage war against it according to lot! We will take from all the tribes ten men to the hundred, a hundred to the thousand, and a thousand to the ten thousand to supply provision for the troops, to prepare for their going to Geba in Benjamin for the outrage it has committed! So that all the men of Israel, united as one man, will amass against this town!

Rose tinted hues paint the backdrop for a waning sun sinking into the rolling vastness of an umbrageous vale. Rows of white tents lay pitched along its glade with their flags dancing in the wind. In the distance a rope attached to a stake leads down into the Valley.

Above the field of wooden beams hang a glowing latticework of lanterns strung together by twine. They flicker and jangle in the crisp flow of sweeping gales.
AWAIT - TRACE #DOWN POLE
We pan down. Below them, a league of savage men skulk between the vineyard's trellises and their twisting adumbrations. Some linger propped up, while others recline. The whites of their eyes pop against the dim light, excitedly panning for motion in the canopies. A hush lulls over the vacantly gawking mob as the sun dissolves into a foreboding dusk. Kish sits amongst them patiently waiting. rubbing the bandaged wounds around his limbs.

We ease out of as Anat's prim face stares back at us dispassionately. Dinah's sparkling pendant hangs around her delicate neck and reflects a nearby flame in each of its jewel's faces. A heavy application of festive liner decorates her shimmering eyes as a hand pencils in eyebrows above her powdery face. A brush brightens its cheeks with blush while another pair of wrinkled hands braid brunette locks below an Atef crown. Colorful ostrich feathers flare out at its sides. An old nanny lifts her hands above their armrests so she can rub them down with oil. She massages her body over a sleek ivory gown fitting her pregnant belly and moves onto to her feet next. Another burns sage ritualistically and chants between the two girls at Anat's side, weaving her way around the glowing tent

The nannies pause to cover their face as the canvas door opens and bow upon someone entering out of our view.
Phineas: Please leave us.
MEDIUM SHOT - ANAT.FACE.LEFT, PHINEAS - STEADICAM - 00:10
Phineas approaches us and eyes the nannies quietly shuffling through the tent's exit. They bow on their way out.
Anat turns away towards us. Her face, lit by glowing candlelight. After a few moments pass, he speaks.
Phineas: You look lovely... You know this is the best possible outcome, given the circumstance. Though we left you with very little choice.
Phineas chuckles. She frowns and turns to him offended, and turns back again towards us solemnly.
Phineas proceeds with a legalistic but sensitive tone.
Phineas: Seeing that, as part of the conditions for your release, you are in my custody 3 and are summarily obliged 2 to do 2 as I say. 3 Do you understand?
Anat nods. Phineas relaxes
Phinehas: Good... Now, you will be permitted to bear the child.
Tears form in her eyes as they widen with anticipation.
Phinehas: However, only with your express understanding that you forego the chance to mother the child as it was conceived out of wedlock and, 2 hence, 3 cannot be welcomed into our community as your valid offspring.
Phineas eyes Anat.
Phineas: Now, if you'll allow me, 3 I would like to propose something to you.
Phineas walks closer. Anat tenses up. We ease in to Phineas face.
Phineas: In my meditations, I have foreseen the birth of a great king. One that is 2 of your decent. Born from your virgin nature. Though it cannot be he, who you carry within you now, as he will have a different role in the cosmic order of what has been revealed to me by God.
We ease out of Phineas.
Phineas: Your next of kin will be with Kish. Whose sordid nature will plant in you a seed that may one day grow to govern the world. And you will name him Saul. 3 King Saul.
Dinah: And this one?
Phineas: Hm?
Dinah: What is to become of him? Will you leave him to die of exposure. Feed him to dogs?
A small child peaks around the corner of the tent entrance. Phinehas and Anat turns.
An older child enters, guiding the toddler by the hands.
A nurse enters scolding the younger child and grabbing the little one.
Nurse: Forgive us Father. They got away.
Phineas: No, that's quite alright. You may leave us.
The nurse looks at him surprised and then looks at Anat concerned, bowing on her way out.
Phineas: Go. Introduce your brother to Anat.
Ahitub guides the toddler over to Anat.
Anat: And what's your name?
Ahitub shyly looks back to Phineas.
Phineas: Go on Ahitub. Tell her your name...
Ahitub shyly gives the child over and walks back to his father, hugging on his leg. Anat takes Ichabod in her lap and paws at his face.
Phinehas: Oh well, he can be a little shy. 5 He would be raised along with these two by their nurse. 2 Your son. 3You would be able to see him occasionally.
Anat: And if it is a girl?
Phineas: It won't be. You're carrying high. I'd bet my life on it.
Phineas makes the point with his forefinger and knowingly smiles.
Anat: Then it will be named Abner... After his father.
Phineas acquiesces Anat turns back to Ichabod and coos.
Anat: You're so sweet. Yes you are. You're a little angel. 3 And you? What's your name?
Phineas looks uncomfortable. Anat turns to him.
Anat: What's his name?
Phineas: Ichabod.
Anat: Ichabod... What an usual name. What's it mean?
Phineas smiles uncomfortably.
Phineas: It uh means... %nn Where is the glory? Or... The glory has left us.
Anat frowns and smiles at Ichabod while dandling him on her knee. He coos.

EWS - BANDITS - DOLLY - 00:10
A group of bandits joke with each other and lean up against the trelises. They see the tent doors rustle in the distance. They motion to each other to be quiet and call for the attention of their comrades.
AWAIT - TOUCH - TENT
WS - HILL.BOTTOM, TENT - 00:10
We see the large white tent blowing in the wind. A band of musicians loiter around the entrance but then arrange themselves, seated on rocks once they realize the dance is about to begin. A hand pokes out of the doorway.

A hand pushes through the tent's canvas entrance. In the background. A troupe of lithe bodies slink out from under the canvasses in demure flocks. fringed awnings flutter above their timid huddles like skirts in a breeze. Dressed immaculately and crowned with elaborate tresses, they exchange diffident glances and anxiously preen themselves, chattering in muted tones.
LONG SHOT - KISH/FRONT - EASE IN - 00:05
Standing opposite, the eager gang of men swarm in anticipation of their prizes. Men trade gloating sneers and parody their feminine movements, raucously clapping and bowing. We ease in on Kish.
CU - ANAT.BOTTOM.LEFT - DOLLY OUT - 00:10
Anat steps out beneath the tent. Her feet are bare and her dress jangles with bells. It is sleek and white. Her face is covered in a cowl. As we ease out, we see many girls doing the same thing. She pauses and begins to remove her cowl.
MEDIUM SHOT - KISH/FRONT - EASE IN - 00:03
Kish, gazing awestruck, recognizes her immediately.
MEDIUM SHOT - ANAT/FRONT - DOLLY OUT - 00:07
Now looking more grown Anat stoically raises her right hand with lowered eyes and glances to her peers who quiet down. The sunset's brilliance illuminates her outline and shines luminescently in her pendant. her long shadow drapes across the valley floor like a cactus. The band begins to play.
CU - KISH/FRONT - EASE IN - 00:03
Kish walks towards us as we ease out and dolly back.
MEDIUM SHOT - ANAT/FRONT - DOLLY OUT - 00:07
She looks sternly at Kish with tears in her eyes. He hesitates and then walks towards her, offering his hand. She wipes tears from her eyes and nods to the other girls.
EXTREME LONG SHOT - PHINEAS.BACK.RIGHT, ANAT - PULL FOCUS
They mimic her lead as she steps forward to accept him. Festive music begins to play and the two parties join.
As we pull into deep focus, Phineas walks on screen and watches the celebration from an overlooking hill.

His silhouette stands in stark contrast to the diffuse evening sky. He drops his gaze.
